# Calculus 1 for Machine Learning

This README provides a concise overview of key calculus concepts relevant to machine learning. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing and analyzing ML algorithms.

## Sigma (∑) and Pi (∏) Notation
Sigma (∑) notation is used to represent summations, while Pi (∏) notation denotes products. These notations help simplify complex mathematical expressions involving sums and products of data.

## Derivatives
Derivatives measure how a function changes as its input varies. In machine learning, derivatives are vital for optimization algorithms like gradient descent, which fine-tune model parameters.

## Integrals
Integrals are essential for computing areas under curves and cumulative quantities. In ML, they find application in probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions.

## Differentiation
Understanding differentiation helps analyze the sensitivity of a model's output to changes in input variables, a fundamental concept in gradient-based learning.

## Power, Product, and Chain Rule
The power rule simplifies finding derivatives of functions raised to powers. The product rule deals with derivatives of products of functions, while the chain rule helps compute derivatives of composite functions.

This README serves as a starting point for grasping these calculus fundamentals,  to delve deeper into the mathematics underpinning machine learning algorithms.
