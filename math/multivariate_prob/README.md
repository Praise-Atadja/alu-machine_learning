## Introduction

This readme is your guide to understanding key concepts related to probability distributions and variance-covariance matrices. Whether you're a student, data analyst, or professional, this resource will help you grasp fundamental concepts in statistics and data analysis.

## Joint Probability Distributions

- Learn about joint probability distributions, which describe the simultaneous occurrence of events involving multiple random variables. Understand how to calculate and interpret these distributions.

## Multivariate Gaussian Distributions

- Explore the concept of multivariate Gaussian distributions, a fundamental topic in statistics. This distribution extends the familiar Gaussian (normal) distribution to multiple dimensions.

## The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution

- Delve deeper into the properties and characteristics of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Understand its parameters, density function, and how it is used in various fields, including data science and finance.

## An Introduction to Variance, Covariance & Correlation

- Gain insights into variance, covariance, and correlation, which are essential in understanding the relationships between variables. Discover how these measures help quantify the spread and relationships in data.

## Variance-Covariance Matrix in Factor Analysis

- Explore the use of variance-covariance matrices in factor analysis, a statistical technique used to identify underlying factors that explain patterns in data. Learn how to represent these matrices using matrix notation.
