1. **Convolutions**:
   - Convolutions are fundamental operations in deep learning used for feature extraction and pattern recognition in images.
   - They involve sliding a small filter (kernel) over an input image, performing element-wise multiplication, and summing the results to create a new output feature map.
   - Convolutional layers in neural networks apply multiple filters to capture different features.
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) leverage convolutions extensively to learn hierarchical representations from raw data.

2. **Pooling**:
   - Pooling is a technique used to downsample feature maps in convolutional layers.
   - Common pooling methods include Max Pooling (retaining the maximum value in a region) and Average Pooling (taking the average value).
   - Pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps, making the network more computationally efficient.
   - It also aids in increasing the network's robustness to variations in input, making it invariant to small translations and distortions.
