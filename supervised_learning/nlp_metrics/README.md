## Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the applications of natural language processing (NLP), and explains key evaluation metrics: BLEU score, ROUGE score, and perplexity. It also guides on when to use each metric.

## Applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

1. **Machine Translation:** Translating text between languages.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment of text.
3. **Chatbots:** Enabling natural conversations with users.
4. **Text Summarization:** Producing concise summaries of documents.
5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying key entities in text.
6. **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Assigning parts of speech to words.
7. **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language to text.
8. **Text Classification:** Categorizing text into predefined categories.
9. **Question Answering:** Answering questions posed in natural language.
10. **Information Retrieval:** Finding relevant information from large datasets.

## Key Evaluation Metrics

### BLEU Score

- **Purpose:** Evaluates machine translation and text generation.
- **Focus:** Precision of n-grams.
- **Brevity Penalty:** Prevents overly short translations.

### ROUGE Score

- **Purpose:** Evaluates text summarization and machine translation.
- **Focus:** Recall of n-grams and word sequences.
- **Variants:** ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W.

### Perplexity

- **Purpose:** Evaluates language models.
- **Focus:** How well a model predicts a sample.
- **Interpretation:** Lower perplexity indicates better performance.

## Choosing the Right Metric

- **BLEU Score:** Use for machine translation and text generation (focus on precision).
- **ROUGE Score:** Use for text summarization and translation (focus on recall).
- **Perplexity:** Use for evaluating language models (focus on prediction quality).
