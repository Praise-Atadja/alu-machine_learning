## General

This Python package, `requests`, provides a simple and elegant way to interact with web services and APIs using HTTP requests. With `requests`, you can easily make HTTP requests, handle rate limits, pagination, fetch JSON resources, and manipulate data from external services.

## How to Use the Python Package `requests`

To start using `requests`, you first need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Once installed, you can import the package in your Python code:

```python
import requests
```

## How to Make HTTP GET Request

To make an HTTP GET request using `requests`, you simply use the `requests.get()` function and provide the URL of the resource you want to fetch. Here's a basic example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
print(response.text)  # Print the response body
```

## How to Handle Rate Limit

To handle rate limiting, you can use techniques such as exponential backoff or retrying failed requests after a certain interval. Here's a basic example using exponential backoff with the `retrying` library:

```python
import requests
from retrying import retry

@retry(wait_exponential_multiplier=1000, wait_exponential_max=10000)
def fetch_data():
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for non-200 status codes
    return response.json()

data = fetch_data()
print(data)
```

## How to Handle Pagination

Pagination can be handled by making subsequent requests with pagination parameters until all data is fetched. Here's a basic example using a loop to fetch paginated data:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
params = {'page': 1}
all_data = []

while True:
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    response_data = response.json()
    all_data.extend(response_data['results'])
    
    if not response_data['next']:
        break
    
    params['page'] += 1

print(all_data)
```

## How to Fetch JSON Resources

To fetch JSON resources, you can use `requests.get()` and parse the JSON response using the `.json()` method. Here's a basic example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

## How to Manipulate Data from an External Service

Once you've fetched data from an external service, you can manipulate it using Python's built-in data manipulation tools such as dictionaries, lists, and pandas DataFrames. Here's a basic example:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()

# Example: Convert JSON data to pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head())
```
